# About
This bundle adds a new type of transport to the Symfony Messenger component. While Mongo is not the best tool to be used as a queue, sometimes it's more convenient to use the tools that your application already uses. For example, if your application already uses Mongo and you want a persistent storage for the failed messages, I think it's quite handy to use Mongo as a storage.  
> At this moment the bundle is still not ready for production, but it will be very soon!
